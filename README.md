# 📱 Bluetooth-Controlled Paper Chassis Vehicle 

This project demonstrates a **low-cost Bluetooth-controlled vehicle** built using an **A4-sized single cut paper chassis template**. The goal is to provide a simple and accessible hands-on electronics project that introduces core Arduino and motor control concepts, especially for beginners or students.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Custom Chassis from A4 Hard Paper**:  
  Designed using a single cutout on A4 hard paper to minimize cost and complexity.  
  Ideal for classroom demonstrations, DIY kits, and beginners.

- **Bluetooth-Based Control**:  
  The vehicle can be wirelessly controlled via any Android device using a Bluetooth controller app.

- **Arduino-Powered**:  
  Simple Arduino code to control motors based on Bluetooth commands.

- **Open-Source Design**:  
  Includes schematics, source code, CAD renders, and printable templates.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Print the Template**  
   Download and print the A4 chassis template from [`vehicle_body_tmp.pdf`](https://github.com/AbrarMahmud/Bluetooth_Vehicle/blob/main/Vehicle_templates/vehicle_body_tmp.pdf).

2. **Cut and Fold**  
   Use scissors and folds as per the template to form the body of the vehicle.

3. **Assemble Electronics**  
   Attach motors, battery, Arduino, and Bluetooth module following the schematic.

4. **Upload Code**  
   Use the provided Arduino code to control the motors based on Bluetooth inputs.

5. **Control via Phone**  
   Pair the Bluetooth module with your phone and control the car using a Bluetooth controller app.
